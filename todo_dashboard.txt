- Needs to be done:
Simulation implementation
Making analysis of simulation

- Ideas:
On analysis tab have a "run" button from which simulation is started.
Next to the "run" buttom have input for submitting the amount of simulations run.
Make time slots savable, so they can be loaded later.
Add dropdown menu next to latex input for standard distributions (replace textarea latex with distr).
Combine importables and inputs tab into one
